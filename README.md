# Routing Type
- client side routing in which SPA works
- server side routing in which a call will be made to server to get the about page and it will be rendered 

# Graphql helps us to over fetching as from swiggy we need only some amount of data not all data.


# why we do not use anchor tag to make the home as url

- because when we use anchor tag it refreshes whole data
- but when we use Link tab it do not refreshes whole data as we can see only that element will get loaded 


# how to do the dynamic routing 

- we can use the useParams hook to get the res id as we created the path like /res/:id
- when we see link element in the inspect in source and we see that link will be converted to anchor tag and this is done by react router dom.

- do not nest the use state and do not call it under if else or under loop 


- Component did mount function render once the render of class is completed and it is used to make the api call and it is like use effect in functional component.
